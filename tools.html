  <h1>Equipments used to identify a typhoon</h1>
  <p class="c2">A barometer can be used to measure the pressure of a typhoon, A barometer is a scientific instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure, it measures atmospheric pressure in units of measurement called atmospheres or bars. An atmosphere (atm) is the unit of measurement equal to the average air pressure at sea level at a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

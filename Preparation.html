  <h1>Things to do before, during and after a Typhoon</h1>

<h3  class="c1">Before the typhoon it is highly recommended to prepare an emergency bag containing necessary things. As it will not be easy to navigate these materials during the typhoon and it will be very essential after the typhoon because most of the basic needs will be damaged and all tap waters are not safe along with that performing activities like cooking is risky during the typhoon. Also create a plan for the members of the family to follow and if the house is not stable evacuate as soon as possible.  <br>
<br>prepare an emergency bag
<br><br>An emergency bag should contain the following: 
<br><br>Clean bottled water
<br>Canned goods
<br>Flashlight
<br>Battery powered radios
<br>First Aid kit
<br>Maintenance & Medicine
<br>secure house
<br>If you have pets save enough food and water
<br>Make a safety plan for your pets<
<br>Evacuate you house if needed</h3>

<h3  class="c1">During the typhoon<br>
<br>Stay tune/updated from the news
<br>Make sure every member is close by
<br>Don't panick, relax although it is normal to stress when witnessing traumatizing situations</h3>

<h3  class="c1">After the typhoon
